                                <h5>Motivation</h5>
                            <p>Thanks to intelligent technologies, many activities can already be performed by machines today. People are increasingly being assigned the role of innovation drivers, therefore the goal for companies should be to build up a creative environment and support creative performances. The aim of this work is to <strong>develop an instrument for measuring creativity</strong> at the workplace - the effect of different working environments on creativity shall be examined in an experiment.
